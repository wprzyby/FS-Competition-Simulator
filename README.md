# To do globally

1. Decide the variables types and write 'const' where possible.
2. Investigate LapTimeParser and Windows issues. [DONE]
3. Extend to include Driverless (implementation and tests).
    - Adam: Trackdrive (tests)
    - Wojtek: Autocross, Endurance, Trackdrive (penalties, tests)
    - Run tests and fix all potential issues!
4. Other calculators [DONE]
    - Made up my mind that there is no need for additional calculators. Already implemented (kinematic, battery pack, RC) are enough.
5. GUI. [Wojtek & Adam, 15.08 - 30.09]
6. Testing, consultations, further improvements, potential delays. [Wojtek & Adam, OCT 2022 - NOV 2022]
7. Prepare info files (can be done by someone else). [NOV 2022 - DEC 2022]
8. Saving state of the programme to file (before competition, after quizzes). [To be set! Must be finished till 07.2023!]
